The genetic target identifiers for this drug include HGNC:3535 (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee), F2 (GenAtlas), M17262 (GenBank Gene Database), 339641 (GenBank Protein Database), 2362 (Guide to Pharmacology), P00734 (UniProtKB), and THRB_HUMAN (UniProt Accession). These identifiers suggest that Angiomax targets the gene associated with coagulation factor II (thrombin), which is critical in blood clotting processes. Understanding these genetic targets can aid in predicting the drug's pharmacological action and its application in conditions requiring anticoagulation therapy.\n",

      "   answer: The cost of Enbrel, as shown in the drugbank-drug_prices table, ranges from $250.37 for a 25 mg kit to $2033.14 for a box containing four 50 mg syringes. In comparison, a 250 mg vial of Angiomax is priced at $780.00. These prices reflect the different therapeutic applications and dosing regimens of the two drugs. Enbrel, a TNF inhibitor used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, typically involves chronic administration, which is reflected in its higher cumulative cost. Angiomax, a direct thrombin inhibitor used in acute settings like percutaneous coronary interventions, has a lower per-unit cost but may be used less frequently or for shorter durations. This pricing structure can guide healthcare providers in budget planning for treatments based on patient needs.\n",

      "   answer: Multidrug resistance protein 1 (ABCB1), also known as P-glycoprotein, functions as an energy-dependent efflux pump that reduces drug accumulation in multidrug-resistant cells by transporting various compounds out of cells. If Prazosin is a substrate for ABCB1, its pharmacokinetics could be affected in that the drug may be effluxed out of cells, leading to decreased intracellular concentrations and potentially reduced therapeutic efficacy.
