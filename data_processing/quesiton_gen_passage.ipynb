      "1. question: What are the mechanisms by which oxaprozin induces apoptosis in immune complex-activated monocytes, and how do these mechanisms compare to other NSAIDs?\n",
      "   answer: Oxaprozin induces apoptosis in immune complex-activated monocytes by affecting specific signaling pathways. The study particularly examined the activity of caspase-3, the involvement of the IkappaB kinase (IKK)-nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) system, and the activity of X-linked mammalian inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). These pathways are distinct from the traditional cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition typically associated with NSAIDs, suggesting that oxaprozin may have unique effects compared to other drugs in the same class by promoting apoptosis through mechanisms not solely reliant on COX inhibition or prostaglandin synthesis inhibition.\n",
