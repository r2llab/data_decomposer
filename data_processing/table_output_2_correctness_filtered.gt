"What are the genetic target identifiers for the drug associated with Angiomax, and how might these influence its pharmacological action or therapeutic application?","The drug Angiomax is associated with the drug identifier ""DB00006,"" which corresponds to the parent key ""BE0000048"" in the drugbank-targets_polypeptides_ext_id table. The genetic target identifiers for this drug include HGNC:3535 (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee), F2 (GenAtlas), M17262 (GenBank Gene Database), 339641 (GenBank Protein Database), 2362 (Guide to Pharmacology), P00734 (UniProtKB), and THRB_HUMAN (UniProt Accession). These identifiers suggest that Angiomax targets the gene associated with coagulation factor II (thrombin), which is critical in blood clotting processes. Understanding these genetic targets can aid in predicting the drug's pharmacological action and its application in conditions requiring anticoagulation therapy.","nan","drugbank-targets_polypeptides_ext_id, drugbank-drug_prices"
"What is the isoelectric point of a drug with a molecular weight of 6963.425, and what processes might its associated transporters facilitate that are crucial for its pharmacological effects?","The drug with a molecular weight of 6963.425 has an isoelectric point of 4.04. The associated transporters that could facilitate important processes for its pharmacological effects include those involved in drug transmembrane transport and response to drugs. These processes are crucial as they ensure the drug is adequately transported within the body and can exert its intended therapeutic effects.","nan","[""drugbank-drug_experimental_properties"", ""drugbank-transporters_polypeptides_go""]"
"Identify the drug classified as a ""Direct thrombin inhibitor"" that is associated with the ""Flockhart Table of Drug Interactions.""","In the ""drugbank-drug_atc_codes"" table, ""Direct thrombin inhibitors"" fall under the ATC code ""B01AE."" The drugbank-id associated with this classification is ""DB00001."" In the ""drugbank-drug_enzymes_links"" table, the ""Flockhart Table of Drug Interactions"" with the ref-id ""L162"" is linked to the parent_key ""BE0002362,"" which corresponds to the ATC classification for ""Direct thrombin inhibitors,"" indicating the drug is likely associated with the drugbank-id ""DB00001.""","nan","[""drugbank-drug_enzymes_links"", ""drugbank-drug_atc_codes""]"
"Which enzyme is targeted by a protein that also interacts with the transporter known as MDR1_HUMAN, and what is the significance of this interaction in drug pharmacokinetics?","The enzyme targeted is ""Receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-1,"" which is identified by the parent key BE0000767 in the drugbank-targets_polypeptides_syn table. The transporter interacting with this protein is ABCB1, identified by its UniProt Accession MDR1_HUMAN and associated with the parent key BE0001032 in the drugbank-transporters_polypeptides_ext_id table. This interaction is significant in drug pharmacokinetics because ABCB1 is a well-known efflux transporter that affects the absorption, distribution, and elimination of drugs, potentially impacting the efficacy and toxicity of drugs targeting the erbB-1 receptor.","nan","drugbank-targets_polypeptides_syn, drugbank-transporters_polypeptides_ext_id"
